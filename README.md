# MovieReviewBoard
Movie Review Board is "a single page application (SPA) with Vue.js, Vuex, Vue Router, Vue's Event Bus and a backend API 
with Spring Boot, Kotlin and GraphQL".  It is a tutorial that can be found
[at this site](https://auth0.com/blog/vuejs-spring-boot-kotlin-and-graphql-building-modern-apps-part-1/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=sc&utm_campaign=vuejs_spring_p1), 
which I'm using to learn more about this tech stack.
